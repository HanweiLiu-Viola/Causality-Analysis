# Causal Connectivity Analysis Toolkit

A collection of custom-implemented causal analysis methods and neuroimaging connectivity tools, including both simulated examples and real-data tested pipelines.

## Overview
So far, this repository contains two categories of connectivity analysis tools:
1. **Causal Methods**: Custom implementations of time and frequency domain causality metrics (e.g., PDC, PSI) based on formulas from literature. These include simulations but have **not been tested on real datasets**.
2. **Imaging Methods**: Neuroimaging connectivity pipelines (e.g., PSI_MEG, PLI_MEG) validated on **real MEG/EEG/fMRI datasets**.
